        <p id="first-para">Oh boy, I was asked to write something about me. As if 200 lines of CSS code are not enough. Yeap, I made this myself. I know what you'll say. That's it's basic. But I'm basic too. Now I remembered the time I used to code in visual basic. Ugh. That was a long time ago and I've forgotten most of it. But the trauma was so deep, I had to join advertising. And so I did. Just another regrettable decision.</p>
        <p id="other-para">No, don't get me wrong. I love it. I've won a few awards and did some funny shit. But the truth is I missed creating stuff. And advertising can be a bit particular about who's considered a creative. Obviously I don't fit the bill, but I don't care to. So I started making stuff on the side. But soon I realized I needed structure in order to make the most out of the knowledge I had accumulated over the years.</p>
        <p>And this is what brings me here. Also: I don't like Star Wars. Sorry but I just can't. I tried. It's not me, it's you.</p>
